# Double Power!

README
Create a coding project that uses a Markov chain to generate visual art!
This is a program that take in an int for user inpurt that is used to determine what state
our agent should begin with. The number represents a time using a 24-hour clock. After creating an
image, there are probabbilities that are within a matrix for the agent or artist rather to determine
what landscape or image to draw next.

artist.py creates an artist and uses the turtle from python to create images.
Day creates an image with a single sun.
Night creates an image with a single moon and a black background.
Full moon creates an image with a single moon and a blue background. The blue is supposed to accent the moon a bit better
Double moon creates an image with a double moon and a blue background.
Double sun creates an image with a double sun.


How the system is personally meaningful to you (at least 1 paragraph).

I am extremely enamoured with time. I have believed from a very young age, almost for as long as I can
remember that I will and everyone will someday die. It is a beautiful truth in my eyes. It makes this
thing called time so precious. I chose to create the landscapes surrounding day and night because time is usually qualified using those terms. Is it daytime or nightime. Those questions also affect the answer
to lots of other questions, in a way that I find limiting sometimes. There is power in the day, and there is power in the night. Have party, or take a nap in the day time. Draw power on the sun and moon forces, and let them charge you forward in the day and night. You don't think about energy when you know at any given moment, it could all go away. 

How did you push yourself outside of your comfort zone?
I did not allow myself to ask for too much help on this assignment. I tried to use the resources provided to me as much as possible. I usually feel like taking on projects like these can be daunting, but I told myself I would put my head down and just get to work and I did. I did start on Sunday and worked for at least 2 hours everyday which I think helped as well.

Why was this an important challenge for you?
It was important challenge because it made me happy about coding again. I missed the feeling of completing a project, and this one has given me confidence that I was very shaky about. I can code and I am not too shaby either. I am not the best, but I am not bad which is important. I belive! That's always a great step in my book.

What are the next steps for you going forward?
I would like to have more detailed images on my landscapes. Adding potentially a house, tree, or some grass even. Something that might make the scene more indicative.

Include a discussion of whether you believe your system is creative (and why or why not).
I believe it is creative to a certain exent. I think a human is capable of drawing and might draw the landscapes that I drew.
